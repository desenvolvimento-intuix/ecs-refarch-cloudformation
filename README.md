# Deploying cluster on ECS service.


### Custom Scripts
1. deploy.sh : Deploys the entire infrastructure
2. validate_template.sh : Validate the structure and syntax of cloudformation yaml template


### Customize the templates

1. [Fork](https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-cloudformation#fork-destination-box) this GitHub repository.
2. Clone the forked GitHub repository to your local machine.
3. Modify the templates.
4. Upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice.
5. Either create a new CloudFormation stack by deploying the master.yaml template, or update your existing stack with your version of the templates.

### Create a new ECS service

1. Push your container to a registry somewhere (e.g., [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)).
2. Copy one of the existing service templates in [services/*](/services).
3. Update the `ContainerName` and `Image` parameters to point to your container image instead of the example container.
4. Increment the `ListenerRule` priority number (no two services can have the same priority number - this is used to order the ALB path based routing rules).
5. Copy one of the existing service definitions in [master.yaml](master.yaml) and point it at your new service template. Specify the HTTP `Path` at which you want the service exposed. 
6. Deploy the templates as a new stack, or as an update to an existing stack.

### Setup centralized container logging

By default, the containers in your ECS tasks/services are already configured to send log information to CloudWatch Logs and retain them for 365 days. Within each service's template (in [services/*](services/)), a LogGroup is created that is named after the CloudFormation stack. All container logs are sent to that CloudWatch Logs log group.

You can view the logs by looking in your [CloudWatch Logs console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?#logs:) (make sure you are in the correct AWS region).

ECS also supports other logging drivers, including `syslog`, `journald`, `splunk`, `gelf`, `json-file`, and `fluentd`. To configure those instead, adjust the service template to use the alternative `LogDriver`. You can also adjust the log retention period from the default 365 days by tweaking the `RetentionInDays` parameter.

For more information, see the [LogConfiguration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html) API operation.

### Change the VPC or subnet IP ranges

This set of templates deploys the following network design:

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | 10.180.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.8.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.16.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the second Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.24.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.32.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the second Availability Zone |

You can adjust the CIDR ranges used in this section of the [master.yaml](master.yaml) template:

```
VPC:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: !Sub ${TemplateLocation}/infrastructure/vpc.yaml
      Parameters:
        EnvironmentName:    !Ref AWS::StackName
        VpcCIDR:            10.180.0.0/16
        PublicSubnet1CIDR:  10.180.8.0/21
        PublicSubnet2CIDR:  10.180.16.0/21
        PrivateSubnet1CIDR: 10.180.24.0/21
        PrivateSubnet2CIDR: 10.180.32.0/21
```
